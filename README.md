# The Technology is Growing
Technology is joining more and more with social life, work and daily life. In this article, I want to emphasize the life that we’re having now. People enjoy using the technology for entertainment, to relax, get distracted, etc. But We can say that We´re depending more on the technologies, applications and softwares in our daily lives.

In Social Life We can see that People hate not talking with their friends, nowadays, It is common to see that many friendships that we have are based on internet communication, People often decide to communicate on Whatsapp, Facebook Messenger, etc.
Most of the endurable friendships have a big communication on social media. It’s funny that many companies tried to invite us to use the messages on our phones, but we loved calling our friends every time, then, in the 10’s the companies wanted to convince us by free calls but we prefered sending messages by Whatsapp, Messenger, Telegram, etc. 
I’m not saying that the number of users have been decreasing on these message platforms, but you can see that many people prefer to have video calls these days, and the reason is obvious: COVID-19. On the Applications stores for smartphones we see that many apps that are for video calling or other ones that you can use to have fun with your friends in your home (Zoom, Discord, Google Meet, etc.) are at the top.

The work. It is a good example of the evolution of our daily activities, that’s why in our history we had industrial revolutions. But, nowadays we can see that technology is so important that we can’t do many activities or tasks with it. As we see in social life, it’s so necessary for this technology to do many tasks that we can do in our homes. The Government decided to send many workers to their homes to keep them safe of the disease, and, obviously, the workers began using the technology, with the new softwares and programs that have been developing we can use many tools and do activities for our work even better.
